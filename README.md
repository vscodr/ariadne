The python version of apollo and it's pretty slick!
I am using swapi.dev to demo it because of the recursive queries. 
This makes wrapping several api's into a single schema a breeze. 
Rafal Piton from Murimee got me up and running with httpx and async / await in python! Very Grateful to him for his time.
